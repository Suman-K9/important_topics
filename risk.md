Financial crime risk refers to the potential for losses or reputational damage that banks and financial institutions face due to illegal activities such as fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, and corruption. These activities can undermine the integrity of financial systems, lead to significant financial losses, and expose institutions to regulatory penalties and reputational harm.
